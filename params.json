I'm an affiliate member of the [4TU Centre for Ethics and Technology](http://ethicsandtechnology.eu/).\r\n\r\n### Research\r\nAreas of philosophy I'm interested in include ethics but also the philosophy of language. \r\n\r\nIn ethics, I'm interested in puzzles in population ethics. What are our obligations to future generations? Are the correct principles of the aggregation of well-being impersonal or person-affecting?\r\n\r\nIn the philosophy of language, my interests lie where questions of meaning and questions of mental content connect. How do linguistic and psychological intentionality relate? Meaning and mental content? \r\n\r\n### Teaching\r\nFor close to ten years, I've designed and taught courses in ethics: business ethics, introductory ethics, computer ethics, medical ethics and more. I like to think and talk about how to improve teaching technique and make it as appealing as possible to students.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nSome papers in progress are: 'Why Does 'Green' Not Mean: Grue?', and 'Functionalism and Action Individuation'. [Here is a link](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/243/) to my dissertation 'A Defense of Russellian Descriptivism', that I completed at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](www.umass.edu) in 2014.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nDon't hesitate to drop me an email at b.h.[LAST NAME]@utwente.nl. \r\n",
