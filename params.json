  "body": "### About Me\r\nI teach philosophy and ethics at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I'm an affiliate member of the [4TU Centre for Ethics and Technology](http://ethicsandtechnology.eu/).\r\n\r\n### Research\r\nAreas of philosophy I'm interested in include philosophy of language and ethics. In the philosophy of language, my interests lie where questions of meaning and questions of mental content connect. How do linguistic and psychological intentionality relate? Which version of functionalism is the most plausible? What does imply for the concept of meaning? In ethics, I'm interested in social welfare functions and puzzles in population ethics. What are our obligations to future generations? Are the correct principles of well-being aggregation impersonal or person-affecting?\r\n\r\n### Teaching\r\nFor close to ten years, I've designed and taught courses in ethics. From business ethics, to introductory ethics, to computer ethics, to medical ethics, and more. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make the teaching of philosophy and ethics as appealing as possible. On this website, I've posted some outlines of different syllabi that I've used throughout the years.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nSome papers in progress are: 'Why Does 'Green' Not Mean: Grue?', and 'Functionalism and Action Individuation'. [Here is a link](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/243/) to my dissertation 'A Defense of Russellian Descriptivism', that I completed at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](www.umass.edu) in 2014.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nDrop me an email at (@b.h.vandergaast@utwente.nl).
