  "body": "### Brandt van der Gaast\r\nHi, welcome to my webpage. I'm a teacher of philosophy and ethics at the [University of Twente](www.utwente.nl) in the Netherlands. I'm originally from the beautiful _[Frysl√¢n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesland)_. \r\n\r\n### Teaching\r\nFor close to ten years, I've designed and taught courses in philosophy and ethics. From critical thinking to computer ethics, and from existentialism to the philosophy of mind. I like to think and talk about teaching techniques and about how to create appealing courses on a variety of subjects. \r\n\r\n### Research\r\nAreas of philosophy I'm interested in include ethics but also the philosophy of language. \r\n\r\nIn ethics, I'm interested in puzzles in population ethics. What are our obligations to future generations? What are the correct principles of the aggregation of well-being?\r\n\r\nIn the philosophy of language, my interests lie where questions of meaning and questions of mental content connect. How do linguistic and psychological intentionality relate? How did David Lewis see this relation?.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nSome papers in progress are: 'Why Does 'Green' Not Mean: Grue?', and 'Functionalism and Action Individuation'. [Here is a link](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/243/) to my dissertation 'A Defense of Russellian Descriptivism', that I completed at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](www.umass.edu) in 2014.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nDon't hesitate to drop me an email at b.h.[LAST NAME]@utwente.nl. \r\n\r\n### Links\r\n[University of Twente's Master Program in Philosophy of Science, Technology, and Society](https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/master/programmes/philosophy-science-technology-society/)\r\n[4TU Centre for Ethics and Technology](http://ethicsandtechnology.eu/)\r\n",
